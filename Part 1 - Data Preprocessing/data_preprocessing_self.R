# Data Preprocessing

# We don't need to import any libraries because they're already present in the
# 'Packages' tab at right hand side of RStudio, just tick the checklist. However, 
# we can still add import commands to import libraries.

# library(datasets)
# This is statement used to import datasets library.

# Importing Datasets

dataset = read.csv('Data.csv')
# read.csv is function used to import dataset and we have imported the dataset
# into a user defined variable named 'dataset'.

# NOTE : R indexed start with 1.

# In R, we don't need to distinguish matrix features and dependent-independent 
# variables.
